# Analysis of Vienna Airbnb Dataset
Welcome to my explanatory Analysis of the Vienna Airbnb Dataset!
In this analysis, I aim to give an overview of the Airbnb market in Vienna. For this reason, I want to answer the following questions: 

a) Listings and hosts:
* How many listings and hosts are in Vienna? How has it developed since 2008? 
* How are the listings distributed between the hosts? Is the market dominated by big player or by smaller (private) hosts?
* Which kind of apartments can be rented via Airbnb?

b) Location:
* How are the listings distributed between the districts of Vienna?
* What are the average prices for the districts of Vienna? 

c) Prices:
* What is the average price per night? What are the cheapest and most expensive options? 
* Is there a saisonality of prices over the year/week?

d) Demand and Occupancy rate:
* What is the average occupancy rate? How many listings have a high/low occupancy rate? 
* What are the characteristics of listings with a high/low occupancy rate? 
* Is there a saisonality of demand over the year/week?
* How has the demand developed since 2008?

e) Reviews: 
* What have customers frequently positively noticed?
